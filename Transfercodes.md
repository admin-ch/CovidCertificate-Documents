# Transfercodes

This file documents how transfer codes are constructed.

## Construction

A transfer code consists of 9 characters.

The first 8 are randomly chosen from the following 29-character alphabet: `1234567890ABCDEFHKMNPRSTUWXYZ`.

Note that the following characters are left out to reduce confusion when entering a code: "G, I, J, L, O, Q, V‚Äù

The final, 9th character is a check character (a.k.a checksum, check digit).
It is computed using the [Luhn mod N algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_mod_N_algorithm)
over the above alphabet.

The purpose of this check character is to provide some level of feedback when the transfer code is manually
entered by test center staff.
